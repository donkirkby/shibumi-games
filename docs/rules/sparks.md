title: Sparks Rules

* designed by Dieter Stein
* 2 players

### Objective
Place your ball on top of the fire.

### Start
The board (a “fireplace”) starts filled with white and black balls in an alternating pattern. The red balls (called “sparks”) are kept ready to hand.

![Start]

### Play
Two players, White and Black, are taking turns by putting a **spark** from the
supply **and** a ball **of their own colour** from the board (the *coal ball*)
into the hand.

Coal can only be taken if it isn't **pinned**. (It is **free**, or it supports
at most **one** ball on the level above.)

If the coal ball was **free**, the player fills the emptied space with the spark
and plays the coal on any other place.

If the coal ball was **not free**, a supported ball will just drop into place:

* If a **spark** dropped, the player **returns** the spark in the hand to the
  supply and plays only the coal ball on any place.
* If a white or black **coal ball** dropped, the player plays both balls in the
  hand on any place and in any desired order.

In this example, white takes spark **x** from the supply, removes coal **a**,
puts **x** there, and plays **a**.

![Move 1a]
![Move 1b]

The next player, Black, takes another spark **y**, removes coal **b** which
makes coal **a** drop. Black has two balls now (**b** and **y**) and plays them.

![Move 2a]
![Move 2b]

### End
The player who places a ball of their own colour on top of the pyramid (the
fire cone) wins the game.

### Strategy
There are at least 14 moves. With each turn the pyramid normally grows by one
ball. Only if a spark is dropped, the number of balls is not increased. No
dropping sparks would be a win for Black. Yet there will be spark drops in
every game and players sometimes can force or avoid them. So controlling the
occurrence of spark drops is essential: White wins by an odd, Black by an even
number of spark drops.

Another way to look at it: you win if the number of sparks is 14 after your
turn. Since the number of sparks usually increases after both your turn and
your opponent's turn, you want the number of sparks to be even after your turn.
Therefore, you want the number of sparks to be odd at the start of your turn.
If it's not, try to drop a spark. Either way, try to set up sparks that only
you can drop, and don't run out of coals that you can drop.
