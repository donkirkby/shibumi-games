Spaiji is the Shibumi version of Taiji, which involves the placement of pieces
of both colours per turn.

### Start
The board starts empty.

### Play
Players take turns adding a white ball and a black ball each turn, in any order,
at any playable points, provided that both balls touch.

### End
The game ends when the pyramid is complete, or when a player cannot play two
balls that touch. The owner of the largest visibly connected group wins.

If tied, the second player (Black) wins.
