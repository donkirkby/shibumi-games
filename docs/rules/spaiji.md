Spaiji is the Shibumi version of Taiji, which involves the placement of pieces
of both colours per turn.

### Start
The board starts empty.

### Play
Players take turns adding a white ball and a black ball each turn, in any order,
at any playable points, provided that both balls touch.

### End
The game ends when the pyramid is complete, or when a player cannot play two
balls that touch. The owner of the largest visibly connected group wins.

If tied, the second player (Black) wins.

Consider White's final move in the following game. There are two possible ways
to fill the final two points, as shown.

![White loss] ![White win]

The first option loses 7 to 13 but the second one wins 10 to 9. White should
take the second option.

Every game will involve exactly 15 moves. The opening player (White) also gets
the last move, which suggests a strong first player advantage.
