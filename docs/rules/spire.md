title: Spire Rules

---

* designed by Dieter Stein
* 2 players

Two players, White and Black, place their own colour or red, without making
clusters of three.

### Start
The board starts empty.

### Play
On each turn, the player places **a ball of their colour or a red ball**. It can
be placed either on an empty board hole or stacking on a 2 × 2 platform.

If a **red** ball is placed then the player **must** play another ball **of
their own colour** in the same turn.

### Placement
**No** single 2 × 2 square of ball locations may include **more than 2
like-coloured balls**.

Playing on a platform is only possible if the colour to be played **is not
already used twice** in the base.

In other words: each and every small 5-ball pyramid may not include more than
two balls of the same colour.

### End
Players **must** place a ball of their own colour. If there is no placement
available (in the beginning of their turn or after a red ball was played) the
current player **loses** the game immediately.

Otherwise, the player who played his own colour on top (the **spire ball**) wins
the game.
