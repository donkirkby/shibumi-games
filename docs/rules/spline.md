title: Spline Rules

---

* designed by Néstor Romeral Andrés
* 2 players

### Start
The board starts empty.

### Play
Players take turns adding a piece of their colour to any
playable point (empty hole or platform).

### End
A player wins by making a flat line of their colour spanning
side to side, or corner to corner, on any level.

Lines on the 4x4 level must be 4 balls long.

Lines on the 3x3 level must be 3 balls long.

Lines on the 2x2 level must be 2 balls long.

The following example shows a winning line of size 3 for White:

![Win]

This shows a winning line of size 2 for Black:

![Win 2]

### Strategy
Most wins will occur on the 2x2 level, by the first player to reach that high.

Every game is guaranteed to produce a winner before the last ball is played.
