* 2 players

### Start
The board starts empty.

### Play
Players take turns adding a piece of their colour to any
playable point (empty hole or platform).

### End
A player wins by making a flat line of their colour spanning
side to side, or corner to corner, on any level.

### Strategy
Most wins will occur on the 2×2 level, by the first player to reach that high.

Every game is guaranteed to produce a winner before the last ball is played.
