title: Sploof Rules

---

* designed by Matt Green
* 2 players

### Start
The board starts as shown.

![Start]

Each player starts with two friendly balls in their stock. The numbers in the
display represent the number in each player's stock, not the number on the
board.

### Play
Players take turns either:
1. placing a ball from their stock at any playable point, or
2. removing a red ball from the board, and increasing their stock by 2.

### End
A player wins with a line of four touching balls of their colour (viewed from
above). A player with no legal moves loses.

For example, the following game has been won by White.

![Win]

Note that Whiteâ€™s winning line of four balls is straight when viewed from
directly above, but not when viewed from other angles. The winning line can also
be a more standard line of four along a row or column, as in this win for white:

![Winning Row]

However, a row can be blocked by balls crossing over it. The following game is
not yet a win for white, although removing one of the supporting reds would
unblock the winning row.
