subtitle: Finding something to build on

### Dec 2018 to Mar 2019 ###
I tried rewriting the `alpha_zero_general` project as [`zero-play`], but I
couldn't get the TensorFlow models to work.

### 6 May 2019 ###
[Minigo] sounds promising. Maybe it has all the features I need for the Shibumi
games project, and I don't need to build my own. It was based on [MuGo], so that
might also be useful.

The [shap] project looks like it might be useful for explaining the models, either
for `zero-play` or for Minigo.

### 28 May 2019 ###
I've been trying to get Minigo to run for a while. I had to install CUDA 10.0
using the instructions for [multiple CUDA libraries], and then I had to
[upgrade the Nvidia driver] to 410. It was a little weird, because they changed
the apt package name from `nvidia-390` to `nvidia-driver-410`. Now I get this error,
and I'm done for the day.

>Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 7.3.1 but source was compiled with: 7.4.2.

### 29 May 2019 ###
I [upgraded CuDNN], and now I can make MiniGo play against itself!

    export MODEL_NAME=000000-bootstrap
    python3 bootstrap.py \
      --work_dir=estimator_working_dir \
      --export_path=outputs/models/$MODEL_NAME
    python3 selfplay.py \
      --load_file=outputs/models/$MODEL_NAME \
      --num_readouts 10 \
      --verbose 3 \
      --selfplay_dir=outputs/data/selfplay \
      --holdout_dir=outputs/data/holdout \
      --sgf_dir=outputs/sgf

### 1 Jun 2019 ###
It looks like Minigo is actually two projects, a Python version and a C++
version. I thought there were just some C++ components in a Python proect.
The Python version also looks like it's just a proof of concept or
documentation for the C++ version. I can't see how to make the Python version
run a complete training pipeline.

I also don't see any obvious extension points for making Minigo play other
board games, so it might just be useful as a more readable template than
alpha-zero-general to base my zero-play project on.

Next, I'll try to get MuGo running.
