## 2018
In [2018], I started the project, building on top of [Alpha Zero General], a
Python implementation of the Alpha Zero project. I got the Spline rules
implemented, but I couldn't train a neural network to be any good at it.

## 2019
In late 2018 and [2019], I started the [Zero Play] project as a rewrite of Alpha
Zero General that was designed to be used as a library to build other games on
top of. I also experimented with MiniGo, but couldn't figure out how to extend
it.
