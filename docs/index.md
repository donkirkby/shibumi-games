title: Shibumi Games
subtitle: Simple board games hiding complexity

The goal of this project is a Python program to play several games in the
[Shibumi] game system, and to build computer opponents for those games.

It's built on top of the [Zero Play library] that you can use to build your own
games. I'm planning to keep a [journal] for the project.
