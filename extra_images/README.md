The `run_povray.py` script is a wrapper around the `povray` render tool that
also adds the shadow on. Someday, it might be worth
following the [shadow technique] for POV-Ray.

Some of the images use a grey POV-Ray image, plus an icon from the [Open Iconic]
project.

The postscript images are another option that I haven't used yet.
