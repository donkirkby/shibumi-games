Play board games that use the [Shibumi] game system of marbles stacked on a 4x4
board, build computer opponents for those games, learn strategy, and analyse the
structure of the games.

## Installing Shibumi Games
Even though Shibumi Games has a graphical display, it is a regular Python package,
so you can install it with `pip install shibumi`. If you haven't installed
Python packages before, read Brett Cannon's [quick-and-dirty guide].

Then run it with the `shibumi` command.

The default installation generates some errors about `bdist_wheel` that don't
seem to actually cause any problems. You can either ignore them, or install
`wheel` before installing Shibumi Games.

    pip install wheel
    pip install shibumi
    shibumi

Known bug on Ubuntu 20.04:

> qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though
> it was found.

This is a [PySide2 bug] that is missing some dependencies. You can work around
it by installing those dependencies like this:

    sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0
