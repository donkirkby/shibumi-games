## Bug Reports and Enhancement Requests
Please create issue descriptions [on GitHub][issues]. Be as specific as possible.
Which version are you using? What did you do? What did you expect to happen? Are
you planning to submit your own fix in a pull request? Please include a game
transcript if that helps explain the problem.

## Testing GitHub Pages locally
The web site uses the [Bulma Clean theme], which is based on [Bulma]. The
[Bulma colours] can be particularly helpful to learn about.

GitHub generates all the web pages from markdown files, but it can be useful to
test out that process before you commit changes. See the detailed instructions
for setting up [Jekyll], but the main command is this:

    cd docs
    bundle exec jekyll serve
